## 0-positive_or_negative.c
   A `C` program that determines whether a randomly generated number is positive
   or negative, followed by a new line.

## 1-last_digit.c
   A `C` program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number,
   followed by a new line.

## 2-print_alphabet.c
   A `C` program that prints the alphabets in lowercase using `putchar`
   a maximum of two times, followed by a new line.

## 3-print_alphabets.c
   A `C` program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in upercase,
   using `putchar` a maximum of three times, followed by a new line.

## 4-print_alphabet.c
   A `C` program that prints the alphabets in lowercase, except `q` and `e`,
   using `putchar`, followed by a new line.

   - not allowed to use any variable of type `char`

## 100-print_comb3.c
   A `C` program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
   - numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
   - the two digits must be different, `01` and `10`
   are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`
   - prints only the smallest combination of two digits
   - numbers should be printed in ascending or, with two digits
   - only `putchar` is allowed five times maximum
   - not allowed to use any variable of type `char`

## 101-print_comb4.c

   - numbers must be separated by `,`, followed	by a space
   - the two digits must be different, `012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201` and
   `210` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0`, `1` and `2`
   - prints only the smallest combination of two digits
   - numbers should be printed in ascending or,	with three digits
   - only `putchar` is allowed six times maximum
   - not allowed to use	any variable of	type `char`

## 102-print_comb5.c
   A `C` program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
   - the numbers should range from `0` to `99`
   - the two numbers should be separated by a space
   - all the numbers should be printed in two digits.
   `1` should be printed as `01`
   - the combination of numbers must be separated by a comma (`,`),
   followed by a space
   - the combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
   - `00 01` and `10 00` are considered as the same
   combination of the numbers `0` and `1`
   - only use `putchar` function eight times maximum
   - not allowed to use any variable of type `char`
