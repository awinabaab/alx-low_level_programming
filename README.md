# ALX Low-level Programming
  - This repository is a collection of directories containing a combination of`bash` scripts and `C` programs as part of my Fullstack Software Engineering  learning journey with ALX.
  - The files contained in these directories demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles of computer programming.
  - All scripts and programs were created, compiled and tested on an Ubuntu 20.04 environment.
