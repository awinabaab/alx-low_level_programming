   - Returns `0` otherwise

## 5-sign.c
   A function that prints the sign of a number
   - Prototype: `int print_sign(int n);`
   - Returns `1` and prints `+` if `n` is greater than zero
   - Returns `0` and prints `0` if `n` is zero
   - Returns `-1` and prints `-` if `n` is less than zero

## 6-abs.c
   A funtion that computes the absolute value of an integer
   - Prototype: `int _abs(int);`

   A function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`,
   followed by a new line
   - Prototype: `void print_to_98(int n);`
   - Numbers should be separated by a comma followed by a space
   - Numbers should be printed in order
   - The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
   - The last printed number should be `98`

## 100-times_table.c
   A function that prints `n` times table, starting with `0`
   - Prototype: `void print_times_table(int n);`
   - If `n` is greater that `15` or less than `0` the function should not
   print anything
